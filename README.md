Welcome to my project! We're using React's `useContext` and `useReducer` to practice. 

## 📝 Our To-Do List:

- 📦 We're saving data in localStorage - Done! ✅
- 🔍 Detect if a product is already in the list (and increment it) - Done! ✅
- 🔄 Update units / price - Coming soon! 🚧

Any advice is welcome! 🎉
