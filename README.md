# 💻 React: useContext + useReducer 🚀

Welcome to my project! We're using React's `useContext` and `useReducer` to practice. 

[Demo](https://juanelops.github.io/Shopping-Cart/)

## 📝 Our To-Do List:

- 💰 User can insert their budget - Done! ✅
- 📦 We're saving data in localStorage - Done! ✅
- 🔍 Detect if a product is already in the list (and increment it) - Done! ✅
- 💵 Detect if user exceeds the budget 🚧
- 🔄 Update units / price - Coming soon! 🚧
- 🦷 TypeScript 🚧
- 📱 React Native version 🚧
- 💻 Backend 🚧

Any advice is welcome! 🎉
